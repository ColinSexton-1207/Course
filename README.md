Practice program using arrays, objects, and classes.


Relearning Java syntax, I've created this program using a practice problem in Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures (Comprehensive Version) by Y. Daniel Liang.

This program is using concepts arrays, objects, and classes in order to practice Object-oriented programming/thinking, and practicing arrays which are used differently than JavaScript, the main language I use.
